# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

  Your answer: 

  Researched answer: 



1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer: git is a software that uses version control. Github is the application that allows users to utilize git. This utilization is in the form of users being able to send code from local devices to the remote source Github, and vice versa. Users can store repository folders on their local devices and push code via the main branch or create new branches to push as well as pull code from. 

  Researched answer: Git is a software found on most computers and is used to maintain files and provide coworking amongst programmers. Github is a website that manages and stores code for developers to access. Developers are able to push code to github and create pull requests that are approved by senior developers before being merged to the main branch of code.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer: Javascript operators such as equality, relational, and logical operators return boolean values. An example of each operator returning a Boolean value is:
  equality operator:
  var myDog = "Jax"
  console.log("Jax" === myDog) // true
  
  Relation operators: 1 + 1 == 2 // true
  Logical operators: var num = 10
  console.log(num > 5) // True


  Researched answer: Boolean values take on only two values true or false. A boolean value that has no value such as zero is a false boolean. Empty strings for example: var favShow = ""; will also output a false boolean. Objects can also act as booleans by using the keyword new. Any Boolean with a value is true.



3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer: An index is similar to the page numbers of a book. When flipping through pages of a book there is information on every page and the page number helps you keep track of where specific information is located. Javascript uses the same concept when using arrays. If the array is the book then the index is the page number and the information on each page(index) are data types.

  Researched answer: Index describes the location of an element stored within an array. In javascript an arrays beginning index is 0. In a array, value is the dataType that has been input inside the array.



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is the concept of repetiting an action over and over. For example, a loop can be considered an iteration because of its repetitive nature. A loop continues to perform an action until a certain condtion is established. 

  Researched answer: As it pertains to Javascript, an iteration is the process of continuing a sequence of events that is established by setting specific parameters to maintain  the process in a repetitive manner. Loops are given a beginning counter of i = 0 and an ending counter such as i < 10 and i++ to intitate the repetition or loop. 



5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer: There are only two roles in pair programming, driver and navigator. The driver shares their screen with the navigator and is the only one that types code. As the navigator, it is that persons job to tell the driver what to type as well as provide additional back up with catching syntax and spelling erros. Other than when switching roles the navigator should never be the one typing code. Some pair programming techniques are that both the driver and navigator take breaks at the same time and that they switch roles often. Taking breaks prevents burnout and switching roles will allow for pair programmers to approach a problem from a different perspective.

  Researched answer: Pair programming is a technique used by developers to tackle coding projects and problems in coding that may arise. It allows both the driver and navigator to bounce ideas off one another while working on a project which is also know as "rubber ducking". The pair really get to know each others coding capabilities and cover for each others strengths and weaknesses. Pair programming can also be used to show coding abilities to interviewers or senior developers. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Similiar to a regular function, a higher order function takes an input and an output. However, the input and output of a Higher Order Function are functions.

2. Jest: Jest is used to maintain or ensure the Javascript performs correctly.

3. Objects: Javascript objects are variables that store collections of names.

4. Method: Methods are used to provide functionality to Objects.

5. Classes: classes are used to create objects in Javascript.
